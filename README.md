Basic AI assistant

Getting AI assistant to register vehicle with local government by telling the owner the required documents to submit to DMV,
allow for user to upload said documents and use the documents to register with DMV with minimal User interaction.

There is no API for my local DMC so I am investigating an API that will work with the API or create a whole new kind of API for this kind of work.
From my experience the DMV is 100 years behind in the technology curve so I may need to find a way to circumvent that restriction. Another option
may be that I need to communicate with DMV about creating an API.
